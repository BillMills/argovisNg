Following instructions on leaflet-draw. After installing everything, I get the errors

ERROR in Error: Metadata version mismatch for module
 /home/tyler/ngArgo2/argo/my-ngx-leaflet-tutorial-ngcli/node_modules/@asymmetrik/ngx-leaflet-draw/dist/index.d.ts,
  found version 4, expected 3

Try: installing latest angular cli
Result: fixed. I think it was that @asymmetrik/leaflet-draw needs @asymmetrik/leaflet versioin 3


make sure leaflet-draw style sheet is included in .angular-cli.json

"styles": [
"styles.css",
"../node_modules/leaflet/dist/leaflet.css",
"../node_modules/leaflet-draw/dist/leaflet.draw.css"
],
